2D Planar Flow Example
========================


In this Section, the target distribution that we are trying to approximate will be defined.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sankhaMukherjee/normalizingFlows/master/results/img/target.png
    :align: center
    :name: target

    A contour plot of the target distribution has been plotted. This is a 2D distribution.

In this case, the target density will be a fairly complex density. This is shown in :numref:`target`.
