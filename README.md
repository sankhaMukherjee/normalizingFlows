# Normalizing Flows

This repository is going to contain test code for various algorithms related to normalizing flows. Most
of the documentation in relation to normalizing flows and variational flows is very terse. In this repo,
we whall cross the t's and dot the i's. This will finally be a self-contained tutorial.

# Documentation

Detailed documentation is present [here](https://sankhamukherjee.github.io/normalizingFlows/index.html).

In this repository, both the math, as well as the code for Normalizing flows as well as variational
flows is present. This is a growing document, and information about new code/documentation will be
added here, so it is easier to follow. 

Documentation for the different parts of the project is present here:

1. Mathematical background
